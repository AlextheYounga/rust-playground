/* 
Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must known the types of all variables at compile time.
However, the compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.
It is not required to set the type of every variable you create. 

Primitive types of Rust:
						(number of bits they take in memory)
	Unsigned Integers:  u8, u16, u32, u64, u128
	Integers: 			i8, i16, i32, i64, i128 (default is i32)
	Floats: 			f32, f64 (default is f64)
	Boolean
	Characters (char)
	Tuples
	Arrays
