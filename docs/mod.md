In Rust, organizing code into modules and submodules is common for keeping projects maintainable and understandable. If you have a nested module inside a folder, you can still use the `mod` keyword, but you'll need to respect the directory structure and Rust's module system rules.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Directory Structure**: Let's say you have the following directory structure:

    ```
    src
    ├── main.rs
    └── somefolder
        ├── mod.rs
        └── somefile.rs
    ```

    In this structure, `somefolder` is a directory that contains the Rust file `somefile.rs` you want to use as a module. The `mod.rs` file is used by Rust to understand that `somefolder` is a module directory and not just a regular directory.

2. **Declaring the Parent Module**: You need to declare the `somefolder` as a module in your `main.rs` or in the relevant parent module file. You do this with the `mod` keyword.

    ```rust
    // In src/main.rs

    mod somefolder; // This declares that you have a module named somefolder.

    fn main() {
        // Your code here
    }
    ```

3. **Declaring the Submodule**: Inside the `somefolder` directory, you need to declare any submodules (in this case, `somefile`) within the `mod.rs` file. This file acts as the root for the `somefolder` module.

    ```rust
    // In src/somefolder/mod.rs

    pub mod somefile; // This declares that you have a submodule inside `somefolder` named `somefile`.
    ```

    The `pub` keyword is used here to make the `somefile` module public, i.e., accessible from outside the `somefolder` module. If you omit `pub`, the `somefile` module will not be accessible from `main.rs`.

4. **Using the Nested Module**: Now, you can use the nested module in your `main.rs` or wherever necessary within your project by employing the `use` keyword or by accessing it through its parent module.

    ```rust
    // In src/main.rs

    mod somefolder;

    // Bringing the module into scope, if you want to avoid repeating the full path
    use somefolder::somefile;

    fn main() {
        // Now you can use items from somefile.rs here.
        somefile::some_function();
    }
    ```

    Alternatively, you can access functions directly with the full path:

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        // Calling the function with the full path without using the `use` keyword.
        somefolder::somefile::some_function();
    }
    ```

This modular approach allows you to keep your project organized, especially as it grows larger and more complex. Each module in its own directory helps maintain separation of concerns and makes codebase navigation much more manageable.
